        <h3>HTML - 101 : Understanding the Basics</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Key Concepts:</h4>
        <p><span class="bold">Webpage :</span> A webpage is a single document on the internet that can contain text, images, videos, and links to
            other pages. It's like a page in a book but is viewed in a web browser. A webpage can also be called a web
            document.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Website :</span> A website is a collection of related webpages grouped under a single domain name. It's like an
            entire book with many pages, all connected and accessible through a common web address.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language</p>

        <p>Hypertext refers to the way HTML allows you to create links within a web document. These links, known as
            hyperlinks, can connect to other documents, web pages, or resources on the internet. This interconnected
            structure enables users to navigate and access information easily by clicking on these links.</p>

        <p>Markup Language in HTML refers to using specific tags to format and organize a web document. These tags tell
            the web browser how to display text, images, links, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it as putting
            special labels around parts of your content to give them structure and style.</p>

        <p>Thus HTML helps to build the very basic structure of a webpage.</p>
