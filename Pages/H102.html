        <h3>Structure of HTML</h3>
        <p>The HTML document can be visualized as a tree: The frame <span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span> element is
            the root. Inside <span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span>, there are two
            main branches: <span class="code">&lt;head&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;body&gt;</span>. These
            branches further break down into child elements, forming a nested, tree-like structure.</p>

        <p class="bold">Root Element</p>

        <p>The root element is <span class="code">&lt;html&gt;</span>, which contains all other elements on the webpage.
        </p>

        <p class="bold">Head Section</p>

        <p>The <span class="code">&lt;head&gt;</span> element in a webpage holds important information that helps the
            browser understand and display the page correctly. This includes things like the page's title, links to
            stylesheets, and scripts. While this information can't be seen by users, it can be read by other webpages
            and web browsers. This helps in rendering the actual content of the webpage better in a web browser.
        </p>

        <p>There are 7 specific tags that can be used in the <span class="code">&lt;head&gt;</span> section of a
            webpage. No other tags should be used in this part of the page.</p>

        <p class="bold">Body Section</p>

        <p>The <span class="code">&lt;body&gt;</span> element contains the actual content that is displayed on the
            webpage. Unlike the <span class="code">&lt;head&gt;</span> section, the <span
                class="code">&lt;body&gt;</span> section accommodates numerous tags that are used in various ways to
            structure and present the visible content of the webpage.
